# Laptop-Cleanup-M1
Script was made to zip files everytime students used school laptops
Task:
Script has zip files recently created during class.
Script has to remove original file to conserve space.
By the end of each semester there should be an option to delete everything.

I know that there are probably better ways of making this script. I'm new to making scirpt and would really like some input.
Thanks!
